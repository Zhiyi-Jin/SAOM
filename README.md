### Social Network Analysis: Stochastic Actor Oriented Models     
             
The purpose of this project is to go through typical steps of longitudinal social network analysis from finding data through formulating hypotheses till drawing conclusions from the analysis of the results. Stochastic Actor Oriented Models(SAOMs) is applied. 
          
Data were derived from the Dutch Social Behavior study, a two-wave survey in classrooms (Houtzager and Baerveldt, 1999). The data files include 19 schools. Two schools(data sets) with similar sample sizes are selected in this project. Pupils in School 7 (N = 54) and School 21 (N = 53) completed the survey in their 3rd, and about one year later, 4th years. Each school is treated as one network, thus there are four networks in total for two waves.
